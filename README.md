# About this project
SFMLPokedex is a personal project that also belongs to a final school project, which is to create a personal software with SFML. 

The purpose of this project is to emulate a basic pokedex with the basic information for each pokemon. The progam has a basic interaction where you can filter the pokemons, search for pokemons, change its description, and unlock pokemons (only pikachu can be unlocked).

To run this program, you must open it and compile the program with CLion and have SFML installed in your mac computer.
