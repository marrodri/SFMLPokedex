# About this project
SFMLPokedex is my final school project for CS8. 

The purpose of this project is to emulate a basic pokedex with the basic information for each pokemon. The progam has a basic interaction where you can filter the pokemons, search for pokemons, change its description, and unlock pokemons (only pikachu can be unlocked).

To run this program, you must open it with CLion and have the SFML library installed in your mac computer.
